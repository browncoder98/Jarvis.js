# Jarvis.js - Version 1.3:



> ***Jarvis.js is a bot I created using AJAX and Node.js using the Discord.js library. The bot is able to perform functions such as retrieving weather info, jokes, Chuck Norris jokes, memes, Minecraft Server Info,  COVID statistics of both countries and overall patients around the world.***

### List of commands:
>1. ***!ping - Jarvis replies with "Pong!"***
>2. ***!hello - Returns "Hi! I'm Jarvis! For my list of commands use $help command."***
>3. ***!info  - Return the functions and info about Jarvis***
>4. ***$help - Displays the list of commands on the discord text channels***
>5. ***!weather {Enter area name} - Gives weather updates of a given region***
>6. ***!joke - Returns a simple pun***
>7. ***!cnjoke - Returns a Chuck Norris joke***
>8. ***!covid {Enter Country name} - Shows the active and recovered cases of COVID patients within any given country***
>9. ***!mc {Enter minecraft server name} {Enter port number}***
>10. ***!meme - Returns a meme from Reddit server***

### Limitation:

>***The repository can be cloned and used for personal use. However, the bot is yet to be hosted onto the cloud via Firebase or Heroku or any other free cloud services. As of right now, the bot needs to be run manually via any suitable text editor. Version 1.4 will hopefully be online 24/7 once hosted on the cloud.***
